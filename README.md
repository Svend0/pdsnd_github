Studing the Nanodegree;
"Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program"

### Description
This project allows the user to select a database, and then run an analysis of the 
Bikeshare data. It displays descriptive statistics of the data once a filter has been applied.
This filter can be a day of the week (or all days) and a month (or all months).

### Files used
bikeshare.py
readme.md
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

Some databases contain gender data and others do not. The program checks for the gender
column and runs additional analysis if they are not present.
